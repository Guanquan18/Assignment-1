                    <h3>What is a road bike?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The traditional road bike has been around since the 19th century and the basic design of a bike has remained unchanged. 
                        While the frame of the bike is the same, evolutions in materials, electronics, and aerodynamics have pushed the limits on what one can do with a road bike. 
                        As the name suggests, road bikes are designed for smooth, paved roads. They typically have drop handlebars, 23 - 28 mm tyres, and shifters to operate both the brakes and gears. 
                        These bikes are designed to be lightweight with speed in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though the days of racing heavy steel bikes up mountain passes are behind us, the aesthetics have remained unchanged. 
                        These days they're lighter, more aerodynamic, and have a few more bells and whistles than their predecessors, but the overall intended use remains: : to enjoy riding on smooth tarmac.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>What kind of road riding will you be doing?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Comfort, aerodynamics and geometry are unique to each style of road bike, so youâ€™ll need to choose one that plays to your strengths and goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The geometry of an aero bike is longer and lower than an endurance bike, as it optimises the rider for better aerodynamics. 
                        The tube shapes ensure air brushes past you whether you're in search of a KOM/QOM or sprinting for the finish line at your local race.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, a more relaxed endurance road bike is better suited for comfort over longer distances. 
                        An endurance bike is designed for sportives, fondos, and long days in the saddle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those of you that consider yourselves born racers, a road race bike will see you all the way around your next race. 
                        These bikes feature the lightest frame materials coupled with high-end components. 
                        Racing bikes are true all rounders- fast on the flats as well as hills and mountains, so they really are ideal for any race or ride situation.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h3>Which groupset is best for me?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo are the three main players when it comes to groupsets. Each manufacturer has a range of groupsets to suit every budget. 
                        A lot of bikes are specced with the complete groupset; however, at the budget end of the spectrum, you may find that brakes and chainsets are mixed and matched to bring costs down.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>What does the 2 year warranty cover?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Warranty covers Canyon engineered parts as well as parts from original component manufacturers, for example DT Swiss. 
                        The warranty only covers material and processing defects that already existed on delivery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Spare and ware parts such as drivetrain components (chain and cassette), paintwork, bearings or cables are not covered by the Canyon warranty. 
                        Nor is any damage caused by external factors from accidental damage, using the bike beyond it's intended use or wear and tear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A warranty claim is independent of the original owner of the bike. 
                        That means, if you've bought the bike second hand and it's less than 2 years old, you can still make a claim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Canyon will cover any associated rebuilding, shipping and customs charges for warranty cases.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h3>What does the 6 year guarantee cover?</h3>
                    <p>
                        However, if issues should arise, in addition to the legal warranty you have, we also offer a 6-year guarantee on our frames, seatposts, cockpits, and forks for racing bikes, triathlon bikes and commuter bikes from the date of purchase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The guarantee only covers material and processing defects that already existed on delivery. 
                        Any damage by external factors is not covered under guarantee. For example, wear and tear.</p>
                    <p>
                        You must be the original owner of the bike and you can make a guarantee claim up to 6 years from the date of purchase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In case of a guarantee claim, the costs of rebuilding, shipping and customs (if applicable) should be covered by the owner of the bike.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the item to be replaced is no longer available in the original color, you will receive another color or an upgrade to the successor model.
                    </p>
